Name: SO2 daily data
Description: |
  This online platform uses data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite and shows the daily sulfur dioxide concentrations coming primarily from volcanic sources. The Copernicus Sentinel-5P SO2 measurements are those retrieved assuming SO2 at an altitude of 7km and explicitly filtering for pixels where a volcanic source is most likely (sulfurdioxide_detection_flag > 0) and where the solar zenith angle is within limits (SZA < 70Â°). The measurements are then mapped on a fixed latitude-longitude grid of 8193 x 16385 pixels. The grid is turned into an EPSG:4326 geotiff file using the appropriate color scale, which is again turned into an EPSG:3857 tile map.
  Note that for data shown, SO2 from potential anthropogenic sources has not been filtered out, and SO2 from such sources can therefore still show up.
